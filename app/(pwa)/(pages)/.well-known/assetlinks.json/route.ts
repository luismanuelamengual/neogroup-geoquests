 * Digital Asset Links of the Android app published in Google Play (a Trusted

 * belong to the same owner, so Chrome opens the site full screen, without its
 * address bar. Configured with environment variables:
 *
 *   - ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME: the package of the app (e.g. "app.geoquests.twa").
 *   - ANDROID_SHA256_CERT_FINGERPRINTS: the SHA-256 fingerprints of the keys
 *     that sign the app, comma separated (Play Console → Test and release →
 *     App integrity → App signing: the "App signing key" one, and the upload
 *     key one to also trust the builds installed by hand).
 *
 * Its path contains a dot, so the auth proxy never runs for it.
